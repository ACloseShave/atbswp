# Automate the Boring Stuff with Python
Following the lessons from Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart

This repo is dedicated to putting into version control the samples, practice exercises, projects, and code snippets of things from the Automate the Boring Stuff curriculum.

By that, I mean I am writing (as best I know how, without using the original material where possible) the code myself to try and learn Python alongside version control practices.

While you can fork this project, this is not intended as a replacement for coding experience.

Seriouslyâ€”if you're trying to understand (instead of merely 'Passing the test'), why would you copy the homework?

Do it your own self!
