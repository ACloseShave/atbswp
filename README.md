Following the Automate the Boring Stuff with Python projects

This repo is dedicated to putting into version control the projects, practice exercises, and snippets of things from the Automate the Boring Stuff curriculum.

It is not intended as a substitute for actual programming experience.

You can fork this project, but reallyâ€”if you're trying to understand the material (instead of just 'Passing the test'), why would you copy the homework? Do it your own self!
