# Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, 3rd Edition
## by Al Sweigart

Just a repo for keeping track of the exercises from the ATBSWP book I'm working through.

Repo is public because I'm keeping track of all coding work outside of my Boot.dev courses and the repo has to be puyblic to track changes.
